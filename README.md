# SQL Aggregate Functions Project

This project is a simple demonstration of using SQL aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG`.

## How to Use

The `activity1.sql` file contains all the necessary SQL commands to create a table, insert data, and run aggregate queries. You can execute this script in any standard SQL environment (like SQLite, MySQL, etc.) to see the results.
